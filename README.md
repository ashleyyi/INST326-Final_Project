The INST326 Final Project by Ashley Yi and Dhruvit Patel models after the color wheel and the color theory. There are seven sub theories in this software deliverable, in which each will take the hexcode provided by the user and return a set of hexcodes that fit the appropriate sub theory. The alternate hexcodes are created by taking the original hexcode and adjusting its hue, light, or saturation values. This project is dedicated towards artists who could utilize this software deliverable to create an appropriate palette of their choosing.
